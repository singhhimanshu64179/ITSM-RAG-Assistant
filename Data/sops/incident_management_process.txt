Title: Incident Management Process (ITIL v4 Aligned)

Purpose:
The purpose of Incident Management is to restore normal service operation as quickly as possible and minimize the adverse impact on business operations.

Scope:
This process applies to all incidents detected through user calls, emails, monitoring alerts, or automated systems.

Definitions:
Incident: An unplanned interruption or reduction in service quality.
Priority: Determined based on Impact × Urgency.
Workaround: A temporary fix to reduce incident impact.

Process Steps:
1. Identification:
   - Incidents are reported via Service Desk, monitoring tools, or API triggers.
   - L1 logs incident with CI, impact, urgency, and detailed notes.

2. Categorization:
   - Select category → sub-category → CI.
   - Choose impact and urgency according to process matrix.

3. Prioritization:
   - P1: Critical business impact.
   - P2: High business impact.
   - P3: Medium.
   - P4: Low.

4. Initial Diagnosis:
   - L1 performs troubleshooting using knowledge base.
   - Apply known workarounds if available.

5. Escalation:
   - Functional escalation to L2/L3 if not resolved in 30 minutes.
   - Hierarchical escalation if SLA at risk.

6. Investigation & Resolution:
   - Resolver groups perform root cause analysis.
   - Apply permanent fix or workaround.

7. Closure:
   - Validate with user.
   - Add resolution notes and lessons learned.

KPIs:
- First Call Resolution (FCR%)
- Mean Time to Resolve (MTTR)
- Number of repeat incidents
- SLA compliance rate
