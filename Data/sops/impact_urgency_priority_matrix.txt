- High: Needs immediate attention.
- Medium: Can wait but impacts business.

Priority Determination:

               Urgency
Impact         H      M      L
---------------------------------
High           P1     P2     P3
Medium         P2     P3     P4
Low            P3     P4     P4

Examples:
- Email outage for all users → High Impact + High Urgency = P1
- Single laptop slowness → Low Impact + Low Urgency = P4
- Business application down for one department → Medium Impact + High Urgency = P2
