Title: Incident Escalation SOP

Types of Escalation:
1. Functional Escalation:
   - Escalate to L2/L3 when incident cannot be resolved by L1.

2. Hierarchical Escalation:
   - Notify managers when SLA breach is likely.

Process:
1. L1 logs incident and performs initial troubleshooting.
2. If not resolved within 30 minutes:
   - Escalate to L2 with clear notes and CI details.
3. For Priority 1 incidents:
   - Notify Duty Manager.
   - Initiate Major Incident process.
4. Resolver groups investigate and update on the bridge.
5. Post-resolution:
   - L1 validates with user before closure.

KPIs:
- Escalation Time
- Percentage of escalated incidents
- Time to engage MIM team
